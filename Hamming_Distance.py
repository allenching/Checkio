Description:
The Hamming distance between two binary integers is the number of bit positions that differs (read more about the Hamming distance on Wikipedia). For example:

    117 = 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1
     17 = 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1
      H = 0+1+1+0+0+1+0+0 = 3

You are given two positive numbers (N, M) in decimal form. You should calculate the Hamming distance between these two numbers in binary form.

Input: Two arguments as integers.

Output: The Hamming distance as an integer.
